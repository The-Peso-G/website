# POA & POA20 on Binance

A large majority of POA trading volume is currently carried out on Binance \(www.binance.com - not accessible from a US i.p. address\). A Binance wallet can be funded with either POA or POA20 to start trading with POA.

1\)  In Binance, go to **Wallet** -&gt; **Spot Wallet** in the top menu.

2\) Select the **Deposit** menu, select POA from the Coin dropdown, and copy the **POA Address** that funds must be sent to. This address does not change whether you select ERC20 or POA.

3\) In your wallet of choice, send the funds to the specified address. To **deposit POA**, make sure your wallet is connected to the **POA network** when completing the transaction. To **deposit POA20**, connect to the **Ethereum Mainnet** and select to send POA20 to the same address.

## Nifty Wallet Example: Sending POA20
