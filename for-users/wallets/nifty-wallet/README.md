# Nifty Wallet

Nifty Wallet is a full-featured browser wallet built for interacting with web3 applications. 

* [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nifty-wallet/jbdaocneiiinmjbjlgalhcelgbejmnid?hl=en)
* [Github Repository](https://github.com/poanetwork/nifty-wallet)

Originally forked from MetaMask, Nifty Wallet has been refactored to include an expanded list of RPC endpoints and features the ability to interact with contracts right from the interface.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Nifty Wallet and MetaMask do not function properly when both are activated at the same time as chrome extensions. To use one or the other, **right click** on the extension icon, go to **Manage Extensions**, and **toggle off/on** the application you want to use. All data will be preserved in the wallet for future access.
