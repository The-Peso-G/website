# Summary & Acknowledgements

## Summary

We believe that such networks with Proof of Authority consensus algorithms will be a trend in public blockchains in the coming years. On-demand systems with trusted validators will play a major role in creating specialized open networks based on Ethereum's protocol. Our goal is to be a model for the generation of networks connected by inter-ledger protocols, such as Polkadot and Cosmos.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to our mentors, advisors and to the many people in the Ethereum community that have been so welcoming and generous with their knowledge.

We would also like to thank the organizers and community members that weâ€™ve met at the Silicon Valley and SF Ethereum Meetups including Roman Storm, Joseph Chow, Martin Koppelmann, Grant Hummer, Tom Ding, Chris Peel, Jeff Flowers, and many others.
