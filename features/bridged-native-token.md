# Bridged Native Token

The POA coin is the native currency of the POA Network. It is used for transactions and fees on the Network. In addition, POA20 is an ERC20 token for use on the Ethereum mainnet. It is bridged to the mainnet and back using POA's TokenBridge.

With [TokenBridge](https://docs.tokenbridge.net), POA is pioneering how blockchains connect and interact with one another. Our cross-chain TokenBridge solutions provide interoperability and scalability, facilitating asset transfers between Ethereum-based networks since May 2018.
