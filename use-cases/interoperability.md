# Decentralized Finance \(DeFi\)

While POA resides on the POA Network, most large-scale decentralized finance applications are only accessible on the Ethereum mainnet. To access these services, POA can be bridged to POA20 and used on the mainnet.

### DeFi Use Case: POA20 as Loan Collateral on [EthLend](https://ethlend.io/)

[EthLend](https://ethlend.io/) is a crypto-lending marketplace where users can provide one asset as collateral and receive another asset as a loan. POA20 can be used as a [collateral token](../for-users/use-cases-of-poa-token/collateral-token.md) to receive a loan in Ether, Dai, or another token you would like to borrow.

A user can select the loan duration and interest payments, then track the loan  through the dashboard. See the tutorial below for information on how to setup and account and initiate a loan with POA20.
