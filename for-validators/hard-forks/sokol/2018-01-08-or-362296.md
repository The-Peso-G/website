# 2018-01-08 \| \#362296

## Info

* **Network**: Sokol
* **Date**: 2018-01-08
* **Block number**: 362296

## Description

### Problems

* The network is not prepared for an HF. The consensus of validators didn't test `multi` option for HF which handles consensus contract transition.
* POA consensus contract on Sokol was outdated from Core. It had no `getCurrentValidatorsLength` method. Voting DApp didn't work correctly [https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-network-consensus-contracts/pull/31](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-network-consensus-contracts/pull/31)

### Solution

* Update [spec.json](https://github.com/poanetwork/poa-chain-spec/blob/sokol/spec.json): add new contract to `multiset` to fix an issue.
* Organize the HF on block 352296
