{% hint style="info" %}
Preferred method to store the keyfiles and information is to store on an encrypted drive. e.g. usb drive

Please do not forget your password for the encryption as you will lose your data and will have to get your old keys voted out and new ones voted in if any issue happens with the validator's node.
